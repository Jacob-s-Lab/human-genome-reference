# HumanGenome
Here is the repo for the human genome reference files and other related files

## Brief introduction 
There are SO MANY different versions of human genome reference files for different research purposes. 
In general, there are several factors contributed to the version of reference genome including official release versions, alternative contigs, decoy sequence. 

### Release Version
Human genome reference is maintained by [Genome Reference Consortium] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc)
Currently, two major releases GRCh37 and GRCh38 are widely adopted by many international genome projects.  
Some regional fixes known as patches are also avalaible after each major assembly has been released.  

### Alternative contigs

Here, I collected different versions of human genome

### Decoy



Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Source           | Name  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
